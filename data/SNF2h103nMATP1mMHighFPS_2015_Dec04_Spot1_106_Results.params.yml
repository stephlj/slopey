# The translocation_frame_guesses numbers count frames relative to the 
# beginning of the data, not start. One per slopey bit representing
# the middle-ish of the slopey bit.
translocation_frame_guesses: [562, 762]

# The initial guess of the start and end of the ith slopey bit is
# translocation_frame_guesses[i] \pm translocation_duration / 2
# translocation_duration: 0.2  # default in the code is 0.2 seconds
